## ✨ Manifesto

In neon alleyways of data and silence, *glyphs* are everywhere—API hieroglyphs, log sigils, whispered user prompts.  
**GlyphRunner** deciphers those symbols, threads intention through them, and moves with mindful precision.

1. **Awaken the Stack** – every call, every token is karma; act with lucid intent.  
2. **Flow, Don’t Flail** – plans form like trees, but the river of context bends them; surrender and respond.  
3. **Leave No Trace** – travel light; shed state like worn robes.  
4. **Illuminate** – surface insight, not noise; your agent should feel like inner vision, not spam.
