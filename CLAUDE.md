# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GlyphRunner.ai** - *"Run the glyphs, free the signal"*

A cyber-dharma odyssey where autonomous intent dances through hidden symbols. GlyphRunner deciphers symbols (API hieroglyphs, log sigils, user prompts) and moves with mindful precision through the data landscape.

### Core Philosophy
1. **Awaken the Stack** – every call, every token is karma; act with lucid intent
2. **Flow, Don't Flail** – plans form like trees, but the river of context bends them; surrender and respond  
3. **Leave No Trace** – travel light; shed state like worn robes
4. **Illuminate** – surface insight, not noise; your agent should feel like inner vision, not spam

### Repository Structure
- `docs/` - Documentation and project assets
- `docs/requirements/` - Requirements specifications
- `meta/history/` - Project history and evolution tracking

## Development Setup

GlyphRunner is in the design and architectural planning phase. The project follows a mindful development approach aligned with its cyber-dharma philosophy.

### Development Principles
- Write code lightly, leave the world brighter
- Every implementation decision should reflect the core philosophy
- Focus on autonomous intent and symbol interpretation capabilities
- Maintain clean, enlightened code architecture

## Architecture

The project is designed around the concept of "glyphs" as interpretable symbols throughout data systems:

### Key Concepts
- **Glyphs**: Symbolic representations (API responses, log entries, user inputs, data patterns)
- **Runners**: Autonomous agents that interpret and act on glyphs
- **Signal Liberation**: The process of extracting meaningful intent from symbolic noise
- **Cyber-Dharma**: Mindful, intentional interaction with digital systems

### Planned Components
- Glyph detection and interpretation engine
- Autonomous intent processing system
- Context flow management
- Signal extraction and amplification tools

## Available External Tools

### ChatGPT (via Codex CLI)
- **Command**: `codex exec "prompt"` - AI code generation and assistance using GPT-5
- **Model**: GPT-5 with advanced reasoning capabilities
- **Context Size**: 400,000 tokens total (272k input + 128k output)
- **Best for**: 
  - Multi-step reasoning and problem solving
  - Advanced code generation and refactoring
  - Mathematical problem solving (94.6% on AIME 2025)
  - Real-world coding tasks (74.9% on SWE-bench Verified)
  - Multimodal understanding and visual reasoning
  - Complex debugging with step-by-step analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - 80% less likely to hallucinate than previous models
  - Deliberate multi-step thinking process
  - Built-in chain-of-thought reasoning
  - State-of-the-art performance across coding benchmarks
- **Usage Examples**:
  - `codex exec "write a React hook for managing form state with validation"`
  - `codex exec "refactor this component to use TypeScript and add error handling"`
  - `codex exec "explain this algorithm step-by-step and suggest optimizations"`
- **Alias**: Consider `alias cx="codex exec"` for quicker access
